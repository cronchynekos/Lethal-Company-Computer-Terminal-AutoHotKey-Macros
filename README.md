# Lethal-Company-Computer-Terminal-AutoHotKey-Macros

Created so that you can interact with the terminal and view the monitor at the same time with ease. 
Only works when Lethal Company is running.

Pressing Numpad1 in the terminal changes your view to the terminal
Pressing Numpad2 in the terminal switches your view of each player
Pressing Numpad4 in the terminal is a global shutdown of every door, landmine, turret or anything that you can interact with in the terminal (experimental --may not work if your latency to the server is poor)
